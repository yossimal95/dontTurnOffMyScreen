# dontTurnOffMyScreen

HI folks!
This is the program you have all been waiting for.. :-)

The LGP (Local Group Policy) at my work forces the OS to initiate a screen lock whenever there is no action on the PC for a while.
Since I found it exhausting to come back from smalltalk in the office kitchen and unlock my computer every five minutes,
I decided to build this small program that will keep my PC awake as long as the EXE file is still running.

Well guess what..? 
Even if you need a nice long lunch break - it wll do the job! ;-)

Have fun!
